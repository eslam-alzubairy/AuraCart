SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
===================================================

PREAMBLE
---------
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide 
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font 
creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to 
provide a free and open framework in which fonts may be shared and 
improved in partnership with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and 
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The 
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved 
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives, 
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The 
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply 
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
